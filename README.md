# Tech-company-site

This project was based on exercise 2 of the course "HTML" in "Fundamentos" of the Fullstack Javascript learning track by OneBitCode.
The objective of the original exercise was to create a simple html only site using the basic elements and page navigation.
The full project now includes:
- A form for contact;
- Restructuring of the html (using semantic elements);
- General styling of the page with CSS;
- Setup for development with webpack and typescript;
